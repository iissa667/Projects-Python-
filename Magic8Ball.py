#A popular childrenâ€™s toy is the magic 8 ball. You ask this toy a question and you flip it over and it
#provides an answer. You will recreate this program using the random number generator and the if
#statement. You should have a minimum of 5 statements.
#You do not need to do anything with the original question.
